* require filesystem for processing our template
* expressjs app server

* Require our *source* interpolator library


* Serve our client-side.html and interpolator.min.js files

* Express is reminiscent of sinatra in ruby-land

* On /, open up our root file and run it through the interpolator. Send the
  result directly back to the browser



* SUPER SIMPLE STUFF just meant to show a basic example of server- and
  client-side usage
